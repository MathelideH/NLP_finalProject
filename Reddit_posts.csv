These are logistically two different supply chains. You have individual preorders, and bulk store stock being shipped out. What you propose basically means that stores cannot get any stock until all individual preorders are fulfilled. It just doesn't make sense. Those that preordered early enough did get their phones before bulk store orders. MUCH EARLIER. I received some of my phones around September 24th or so. Some people even earlier.

Contrite17	summonerschool	1	-1	-1	2016-11	1478104917	Short answer No, long answer ~~depends~~ still no Lets look at the Yellow options. Flat Armor, Flat Health, Scaling health, and scaling Armor. Flat Health is the strongest early, but is very quickly beaten by the other options. (Like level 2-3 Flat Armor is better already IIRC). Flat Health is pretty much only used on Supports who dont level quickly and need efficient stats. Flat Armor is the long lived king of runes. Strong early due to ample amounts of PvE Physical damage, like minions. Also scales well with lifesteal and health. With scaling Health, you break even with stats with flat armor at 6. If you aren't pressed for early armor (like not vs riven), then these are quite strong and a very popular choice on solo laners now. Now lets look at scaling Armor. Yea, you do technically break even at 6, but you really dont in comparison. At 6 they are as effective as flat armor, but let's assume you chose them since you decided you didnt need armor early. Well now its level 6 and having the armor likely still doesnt matter if you didnt need it early. In contrast, scaling health is still offering something useable since it'll work well with your blues. So I dont really see a scenario where you would opt out of Flat armor for Scaling Armor in which Scaling Health isnt better than Scaling Armor.

0	Thanks for the long and detailed response, but I should have mentioned that I loved the way the Zeds talk and had character in KF1 and wish they would add that in KF2 (which is seems like they are starting to do) but I'm confused about one of your points, you talked about how that in KF1 that you have combos to kill the big Zeds quickly, you also have that in KF2, so it doesn't really make that much sense, But thanks again for the detailed response.	Nathan8911	killingfloor	1	-1	-1	2016-11	1479315088	And that's exactly what I like about KF1, you can't just use bullshit sprint and run away from danger, that feels so cheap. You always have to have good awareness and getting surrounded in KF1 can always be a death sentence. You always have to make the best decisions in positioning, like whether you can hold your ground or run away and risk running into other zeds. Or whether or not you can squeeze through a path by shooting your way out, if you miss your shots you're dead, it's very intense and strategic. Also in KF2 if you wanna play HoE solo you better take a class that has movement speed, you're gimping yourself so hard and it's abysmal trying to outrun zeds without passive movement speed. Sprinting zeds is what broke the game balance wise, and is a reason it won't ever be as strategic as KF1. You already addressed this later in your comment and I agree how in KF2 it's incredibly stupid how when you get surrounded and you think you're dead, but the ai decides to ignore you and go for your teammates instead, so you can walk a mob of zeds right by and live when you shouldn't have. It feels cheap when it happens to you and rewards bad players. As for berserker I actually like him more in KF1, not because he's OP, but because you're not forced to move in a direction you don't want just to get the right swing. WASD controlling swing directions in KF2 is really lame and I hate it. As for the atmosphere KF1 definitely takes the cake, gritty and dark maps really make you immersed in the worlds. Unlike KF2 which has generic futuristic boring theme to it that I don't really like. Also I'm a bit confused how you don't think the zeds are better in KF1, sure the graphics aren't the best but they all talked and had character to them, they were legit creepy when they sneak up on you and whisper in your ear. In KF2 the zeds are just unscary, boring meat puppets imo. Also you could have a lot of fun using chat commands conversing with teammates, none of that in KF2. As for depth just the classes itself have way more depth in KF1. There's combos each class can do to deal with big zeds and it can take a while to master them and feels really rewarding when you pull them off in the heat of the battle. In KF2 there's really no depth to the classes, it's pretty much all the same whether you're lvl1 or 25 and there's nothing to master in them. It's like you can unlock X perk and you can now spam the head and kill the big zed just from sheer damage. Much skill. In KF1 the classes actually felt unique and each had a specific role in the team. In KF2 everyone's pretty much a better or worse trash clearer, and you can be 2x better than your teammate but no way to show it, because you're just another trash clearer same as everyone else. HoE gameplay is boring as well, brainless trash clearing until the beg zeds spawn and then for a moment everyone holds MB1 and spams the bullet sponges, and then goes back to trash clearing. With the addition of sharpshooter it got a bit better, but it's largely still the same and incredibly boring for many classes up until when big zeds spawn. I think I've rambled enough lol. I'll probably get downvoted as always, because everyone who feels the same as me have long left the sub and it's mostly newcomers or other who are hardcore fanboys of KF2 have stayed. None of my KF1 veteran friends like KF2. Tripwire dig themselves a grave because they catered to mainstream casual gamers.

PrivatePolicy	australia	2	-1	-1	2016-11	1478303529	"The Australian Greens' immigration and refugee policies do not propose to abolish vetting and assessment of refugee claims, which is what ""open borders"" would actually mean. They push for faster processing to eliminate the suffering we currently see in offshore detention, which you'd think would matter to people supposedly worried about drownings. Their approach would arguably be preventative against having to resort to people smuggling in taking on the international burden of refugee resettlement, but if it couldn't done, would ensure people end up somewhere instead of us paying to keep them in expensive processing centres out at Nauru and Manus. I guess the majority of voters don't know how to get to the Greens website and read their actual policies."

If you make your app into the platform FB has then maybe you'll get that leverage, but since you don't, you don't get that. Why would they offer you such an advantage? That is an issue of making a business successful and forming partnerships and a strong, loyal userbase. It's not up to someone else to promote your startup... that's asking for handouts. This is a business issue, not net neutrality. If I build a new app tomorrow, who's responsibility is it for it to either sink or swim? Mine, and mine alone. Going around saying ""Oh, it's not fair, there's so many more apps out there like mine"". That's dumb. Why would you build a social app which has no attraction to pull people away from FB. That's a bad idea and a failed business venture... net neutrality has nothing to do with it. If you think so, you don't understand what NN is. As for the issue at hand, those speaking loudest about their ""net neutral rights"" have no clue what their rights are and I'm pretty sure have not read their contract as to what they've signed up for Meteor be be allowed do/not do. Net Neutrality anyway is just some utopia for hippes who have no concept of business, money or the infrastructure needed. If I like in a large city among many houses served by an ISP, it's easier to get me service, thus the cost is less. If I want a dedicated line such a business, I can, but I have to pay more for it. Insisting I get it for free because ""it's not fair, they have more money, they can afford better stuff than me"" is stupid, that's how the world works. Equally, if I build a house on top of Everest... and then complain I can't get the same speed internet installed as I have in my city house, at no extra cost, then again, that would be stupid.... because SOMEONE has to pay for the infrastructure to install it and expecting it for free is a non-runner. Who exactly would pay for it??? I could go on and on about the things NN wishes for or what people *think* NN is about, or why people *think* NN is some god given right when ISP's are not actually bound by it, but it's been done to death on here. Some will argue over anything."

0	sorry for my poor wording hehe (am at the hiryu/bogue atm and only use automatic drops when i know im dead and cant get the strike in manually)	DunK1nG	WorldOfWarships	2	-1	-1	2016-11	1479535827	You want to get good at 1. Manual drops. (Manual drop with alt) 2. Grouping up your planes in groups and attacking as one group. (Select multiple groups holding down shift) Sometimes it takes patience to find an opening on a good target. I find myself using my 1 USN fighter squadron on Essex to run interference against enemy fighters most of the time. If you can provide AA cover for your fleet that is awesome too. Occasionally you can use your fingers to help soak up some surface AA fire. Kind of a waste, but depends on the situation. Depending on the enemy loadout, once your strike group is spotted you'll want to get in quick and get out quick. You want to minimize time on the AA zone. If I run into defensive fire I *usually* break off and run straight away. Wait for it to dissipate or find another target. My torpedo planes will usually lead (and help determine the angle of attack for the Dive Bombers) *Or* they will follow and hit a weakened battleship or cruiser if it could finish it off. Halted/reversing battleships/cruisers are prime drop targets. I *usually* send all 3 Dive Bomber squadrons in at once on the same target and manual drop. **but** once you get used to it and become good with accuracy and expected damage, you can start sending in single squadrons on near death targets to save bombs, *or just spread them out to spread duration fires*. Takes some more micro managing but can really be clutch when needed. I tend to keep my fighters over friendly AA. Try to optimize their help as much as possible.

But courtship is now considered harassment whether it's a stranger, your coworkers, or a friend. How exactly is a heterosexual male supposed to properly go about initiating contact with women in order to start a relationship? Why, if I didn't know any better I'd think this whole thing was really about demonizing the male sex drive.

Yo_2T	personalfinance	1	-1	-1	2016-10	1477581363	What kind of used car are you buying for 20k? What is the interest/terms of the loan you are looking at. If you only have 6k in savings then maybe you should consider another beater car, especially if you're goal is to save up for a home. 20k would be a nice chunk of money toward a down payment if you were to save it up instead of paying off a loan.

0	There is no sales tax on the sale of bottled water in Michigan.	Fourty6n2	worldpolitics	2	-1	-1	2016-11	1480519953	I think Nestle gets away with it by telling the state how much tax money they will get from the selling of said water to consumers. All the retail taxes and then the industry work too is more tax money than if the government protected that water, so they give it away. It's horribly short-sighted and is a very short term gain but that's why politicians are assholes. They only care about what benefits their perception and the measurable things they can run on in the next election.

0	Just for clarification, is that all in New Zealand Dollars?	ApteryxAustralis	politics	1	-1	-1	2016-12	1482138408	Having lived in NZ for many years, this is true. Products that had to be shipped in were overpriced, but otherwise prices were on par with what you would expect in the US. Fast food might be more expensive, but that's because labour is a major expense of fast food businesses. It makes sense that that cost would be passed on to the consumer. But for the most part, food in supermarkets and other essentials like toiletries weren't more expensive because they aren't wage dependent. Clothing was also on par with American prices. Things like animal products were more expensive, but that was because the country has much more stringent animal cruelty rules that prevents factory farming than we do in the US. Also rent was reasonable, at one point I was paying $255/week for a two bedroom flat in the middle of the city near the university (total - no flatmates). I don't remember what my electric bill was, but cable internet was ~$60 per month iirc and I didn't have the cheapest plan. My cell phone bill was ~$15/month but I didn't go for much data since I had wifi most of the time. I didn't own a car because public transport was pretty terrific, so maybe another $15/week for the bus. I lived pretty comfortably and was even able to save quite a bit at the then minimum wage of $13.25. (Just some perspective, experiences may vary and this was roughly 8 years ago)

I've posted this story before, but any excuse to post it again. My uncle is a stand up comedian, and has been since the 80s. Some time in the mid nineties he was on tour around various UK seaside resorts, but this was a spring tour, and most places were pretty dead. With nothing else to do, he ended up going out for curries most nights. One Sunday afternoon in Wales, he was getting ready for an afternoon show. The night before, he'd had a particularly hot curry, and he'd been punishing his bowels for a while now. In short, he was suffering. His stomach was aching, but worse than that, he had a case of what could only be described as the fiery shits. He couldn't imagine going on stage for an hour and a half in that sort of discomfort. He could barely get away from the loo, and he was in agony. Thankfully, his tour manager was a pro, and suggested that cold milk, applied directly to the inflamed area, would work wonders. Problem was, it was a wet Sunday afternoon in a Welsh seaside town in the mid nineties. Nothing was open. After almost an hour, they gave up and went back to the dressing room, where they realised that there were a couple of those little long-life milk pots. They weren't ideal, but they were out of options. Of course, the angles were all wrong, and my uncle wasted the first one completely. Emptied it down his leg. Which is why, when the technical manager came into the dressing room a few minutes later to tell them they had half an hour before the curtain, he found my uncle bent over a chair with his pants around his ankles, holding his bum cheeks apart, so that his tour manager could carefully empty the contents of a tiny pot of milk into his exposed anus. They both turned as the door opened, and stared at the technical manager. Neither of them knew what to say. Before they could even attempt an explanation, the man just backed out and closed the door. He never spoke to them again, the whole time they were there.

There are competitive games when the Lee gets 4/5 early kills and has a lot of gold spare. Do you think Protobelt would ever be a (of course situational) competitive purchase? I think about it like an early Swifties or moby boots. It is something that fits certain situations really well. If you get it early you can GAP close to again to open up gank opportunities. The burst is quite strong early game and can increase his kill potential on squishes. It provides health and CDr so not all stats are wasted. It provides wave clear to shove waves into turrets faster (big deal) it increases clear speed and opens up opportunities for counter jungling. AP contributes to shield. I think Protobelt is a highly situational purchase but it can see competitive play on Lee Sin. Please Reddit Analysts! Help add diversity to the rift and make it great again!

I am playing a Blue/Red deck which I know is not super-competitive but it's fun deck for me (and it's cheap, which I like even better). But I do want to start sideboarding against specific decks that I see playing at my local store. The first one that I'd like to beat is a combo with Nahiri, the Harbinger and Emrakul, the Aeons Torn. Nahiri ticks up and activates her -8, Emrakul comes in and attacks, I sacrifice 6 permanents and take 15 flying damage. blargh Are there good answers in Blue or Red for this? Attacking Nahiri works sometimes, but she ticks up so fast that I also want to have something available for the turn that my opponent tutors for Emrakul.

Her friend responded with ""I hope you hit him for that, I would have punched him"". This girl was also chain smoking cigarettes, had this weird anxious stutter in her voice that made her sound kinda nuts, and taking shots all night. Very masculine behavior. I was hanging out with the girl whose boyfriend got pissed about the number thing and said ""Why wouldn't you just dump him and walk away? Violence is something reserved for immediate physical threats.. Like someone attacking you."" She couldn't even give a straightforward answer. The other girl (who's an E. European) said ""Yeah but chances are he'll just hit you back"". American women are utter trash these days. They're on all sorts of prescription medications for their neuroses and do not even take care of themselves or have the ability to adequately do household tasks.

There were two brothers who were drunk and fighting over who's job it was to carve the turkey, they struggled over the electric carving knife and one of the brothers tried to decapitate the other with the electric knife. His head did not come off completely, but, needless to say he did not survive. My Dad recently told this story to me. He saw a lot of crappy stuff as a cop.

0	I honestly think it might just be that body hatred on that level is completely normalized for women and so our struggles aren't so apparent.	hotsouple	GCdebatesQT	6	-1	-1	2016-12	1482881060	"Your first paragraph is very reassuring. I really am afraid of coming across that attitude. Maybe, if this isn't over-introspecting, I'm prone to expect that attitude from people because I have it with myself. I look at the few people who have happily detransitioned, and I look at happily GNC males, and I think, ""what's wrong with me? Why can't I just be like them?"" I see where you're coming from with the second paragraph. That's not my intention at all. I do see that many more women seem to reach a peace with their bodies than trans people. That does make me think one of the following three must be true: * Women's body issues are easier to overcome than trans people's * Women with body issues have more fortitude than trans people * Women with body issues don't have transition as an option, so they're forced to make do with the hand they're dealt. As I've had more discussions in this space, I'm leaning away from the first one and more toward the third one. Maybe I'm a chauvinist pig for never seriously considering the second one! X)"

0	What do i have to do in order to become a monk so you can tell me?	JustF-nGo	AskReddit	128	-1	-1	2016-12	1480773616	"I just remembered another one, A man is driving down the road and his car breaks down near a monastery. He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, ""My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?"" The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound. The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" Distraught, the man is forced to leave. Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again. The monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" The man says, ""If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk."" The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk."" The man sets about his task. After years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks. ""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception."" The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound."" The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door."" The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond. Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door."" The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door! With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound... But, of course, I can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk."

Asking questions can be difficult for people, always answer the question to encourage someone to better themselves through the pursuit of knowledge. Unless this persons question indicates they are dangerously unfit to be performing a duty that places others at risk, there is no benefit to degrading them. We all want to learn, so let's all be good teachers when we can. The stupider their question seems to you the more you probably know about the topic in question, so take this chance to really open up their world to something new.

1	YA MAKE REDDIT GREAT AGAIN	forpostingaboutdrugs	Drugs	4	-1	-1	2016-11	1478703392	Alls he's saying is: Stop being a fucking sad sack and take a step back every once in a while. While problems and issues are relative to wealth and status, doesn't make yours any more worse than somebody else's. OP could be an 18 year old homeless junkie addicted to Heroin panning daily just to afford his next sack. In retrospect, the kid needs to stop fucking doing drugs, quit the benzos, get a proper job or pursue higher education. Literally 6 months off drugs will be enough to change his life. Him posting here for a bit of karma and circle-jerk 'depression comfort' will solve nothing. We need more people laying down the reality of situations, offering real solutions to problems. REGARDLESS of how many feelings are hurt. Fuck yo' feelings

0	The man doesn't accept basic scientific facts, but sure, OK, yeah, EVERYTHING is going to be JUST fine... You're absolutely delusional.	carbondioxide_trimer	gaybros	9	-1	-1	2016-11	1478710568	Everything is going to be fine. There is nothing to worry about. LGBT rights have already been ruled by the Supreme Court so there is no changing any of that. The president doesn't have as much power as you think they do. It's great that we don't have a Washington elite in the White House right now. All you see on the media was meant to scare you. Look at trump on paper rather than what you've seen or heard from the media and the people around you. As a transgender person and member of the LGBT community, i thought I'd be the last person to even think about supporting trump. I may not agree with a a lot of things the Republican Party supports, however trump is different. There is a reason why a lot of his own party doesn't want to support him. With all that aside, the only things that will change are other matters, but civil rights I think we are safe. We just have to ride the next 4 years out. For once the people have been able to have a voice in our own elections that go against the bribed government and business, you may not like or even want the current president elect, but my friends what has happened I believe is a good thing. With all that said as long as the country doesn't explode out into an all out riot. Everything is going to be okay. I already know that a lot of you are going to come out and comment and rage with your own opinions because of this, and that's okay. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. I'm just simply trying to offer some comforting words.
0	Yes, the precedent of repealing amendments to the constitution should frighten everyone, in over 250 years we have repealed one, and the massive groundswell in the media about the effort to repeal the 19th should scare everyone, they can't stop talking about taking women's right to vote, the commentary is non-stop.

NOW they show her as the stoic leader, NOW they show her as a beacon of hope, NOW they show her as the Hillary she actually was this whole time.

I know food becomes repulsive on meth and will maybe make you nauseas, your teeth and your organs need the work and the nutrition to keep working well. Second, stay hydrated. Meth will eliminate your thirst instinct. When you are dehydrated your teeth get dry constantly, you get tooth decay. Finally, brush your teeth every single day at least once. No excuses. Just do it with a tiny piece of that limitless meth energy. Follow these three rules and you can use meth while never effecting the teeth.

The vast majority of people live in states which the candidates didn't even campaign in. A better way to do it would be to allocate each electoral vote in proportion to a candidates victory in a state -i.e. if you win 60% of the vote in California you win 60% of California's electoral votes (perhaps with some restriction allocating them only to the top three candidates). That way there'd be an incentive to campaign everywhere rather than a handful of swing states.

A guy I know voted for trump never says a racist or sexist thing, but he thinks that more black people get arrested because they are more violent. This type of stuff has been proven over and over. Blind auditions with symphonies have pretty much gotten rid of gender bias, where they would favor a man over a woman. They went to great lengths too, even wearing things that would muffle their walk as to now give away gender. These Biases exist everywhere, but very few people want to even admit they have them. And this isn't me saying this. It is all backed by science.

They chose to hype lies and promulgate slander against the one person who represented what they claimed to believe. They ignored Bernie's track-record of honesty, straight-forwardness and being an excellent prognosticator on every major issue to face the US for the past 30 years. They ignored (and sometimes aided) Team Clinton cheating and, worse, turned a blind-eye to Sanders as he continuously (and against much advice) stuck to the high road.

Aim to get as large as you can. * **Troi Marin** (house rule) - cannot hold neighbouring provinces or border subjects; all provinces must have sea access. Aim to become an Empire. * **Europa Iuliani** (goal) - begin with a custom Pagan nation in Europe; eradicate Monotheistic (Christianity, Islamism, Judaism, Sikhism and Zoroastrianism) religions off the continent. * **Oua Mate** (goal) - begin as a Coptic nation; convert all Catholic, Protestant, Reformed and Orthodox provinces and countries to Coptic. (Optional: Coptic must be the sole religion in the European continent and the Maghreb, Egypt and Horn of Africa regions.)

And even supposing that Goku has to stand still and does not move at all, roadhog cant pull him. Roadhog would probably have problems thanks to the weighted clothing, but not only that, Goku could just pull Roadhog. Even simpler, IF Goku allows Roadhog to pull him, Neither Roadhogs gun POINT BLANK, not Roadhogs fist could damage Goku at this point. As for Proof? A Farmer with a shotgun has a powerlevel of 5. Thats a single guy. We could probably argue that 100 Farmers with shotguns can kill Roadhog. Thats 500 in terms of power levels added. Goku at the start of the saga surpresses his powerlevel. And it is 5000. But wait, then comes the unleashing power and the Kaioken, inspiring the famous ITS OVER 9000 line. Roadhog gets Roadreckt. End of story, not even a slight contest here, just a stomp for goku.

0	since you guys make every spell looks different even in black and white, why the colour should be different as well?	devilsworkop	heroesofthestorm	1	-1	-1	2016-11	1478893009	I'll take the heat (heh) on this one. Artists work closely with us designers to maintain clarity of gameplay. The reasons his tints are as similar as they are is because we simply can't dip too far into the color spectrum of other heroes, which can and does confuse players as to which hero exactly is attacking them. Green flames, for example, are Gul'dan's thing. White hot flames looks like holy light, which encompasses several heroes (Uther and Tyrael to name a couple). There are no hard and fast rules here. Sometimes we do change the color scheme drastically (Queen of Ghosts Kerrigan I'm looking at you), but we review them on a case-by-case basis. Fire, unlike ice or lightning or slime or any of the other prime elements, is used more than any other in our game - and so we need to keep the fire FX more firmly within the spectrum of their base skin. Every skin pushes different vectors. Some push the colors, some the silhouette, some the sounds. Some push everything a little bit equally. It's a real tightrope act making cool skins (and color variations) that look appealing, yet don't muddle the gameplay significantly. I think Ragnaros has more leeway to push his model than his colors, which is why Mini Rag is as awesome as it is.

A Leap also makes you untargetable for most of the duration of the actual Leap and thus cannot be interrupted while you can be caught and CC'ed mid-Dash. The only weakness of a Leap is Awilix's ultimate.

I watched a bunch of videos on yt to learn some stuff but during a match I am doing a lot of mistakes, which is actually fine for me. Anyway, I am searching for an Urien guide or some people who could tell me what the really important moves/buttons are. E.g. I dont really know what to do after Dangerous Headbutt, Chariot Tackle or Knee Drop. I seems like grab is the only thing that works or I get free grabbed on block. Moreover I would like to know if there are specific matchup tipps anywhere? I struggle against nearly any female character. Thanks for your help and replies in advance!

In the process, I discovered that using Advanced Training before landing on Haestrom leads to a weird bug in the PC interface. The bonus power shifts to the #8 power spot, and the ""Unity"" and ammo power slots no longer get shaded red when they are unneeded/in use. I tried this again with Energy Drain and with a different playthrough, and it happened both times. The problem was fixable by removing all items from power slots and adding them back from the bottom toolbar. Is this something that has happened to anyone else, or is this a unique bug?"

0	Honestly I noticed the issue completely go away after a clean install/factory reset.	miahrules	Nexus6P	3	3	0	2016-09	1473874267	Have the battery problems officially been Acknowledged by Google? So, just like a 'few' others here I'm still pissed at Google. There were 5 developer previews and most people didn't have any problems with them - besides stability and app compatibility - and when the final release hits, we got battery drain that cripples the phone heavily. I don't wanna use Battery Historian, X root apps, use a custom kernel or disable the backup functionality of my Android phone just so that I get 'about the same' battery life that I had when I used 6.0. I effing 'need' my phone for work, I can't plug it in every 3 hours when I have to use it heavily/have shitty reception. So, my question is, have the battery problems been acknowledged anywhere? The Android bugtracker? I remember that Hiroshi Lockheimer told someone on Twitter to DM him about his problems but a bunch of users mentioned him and nobody knows if he really got any logs or descriptions about the problems. Do we really have to wait until 7.1 hits when the new Pixel devices hit the market? (If we can be lucky enough to get it directly after launch without Google doing some kind of exclusivity for 7.1 for the Pixels). Even if it hits, we don't have any confirmation about them addressing the bug, who knows if it's even gonna get fixed in 7.1? Really, if Google wants to make the iPhone competitor they may make with the Pixel devices, they have to step up their game. Apple would be arrogant but acknowledge those bugs somehow but Google is silent about them AFAIK. (Sorry, I just had to rant somewhere and I connected that rant with a question, so feel free to answer the question and react/rant with me.)

I was at the game on Sunday and made it a point to keep an eye on Agholor after the huge 3rd down drop. I wanted to see how his teammates would react to him on the sideline. Nelly had poor body language (shocking!) and proceeded to make his way towards the bench to sit down. WR Coach Greg Lewis went over to Nelson as soon as he began to sit down and it looked like he had a very heated and animated shouting discussion directed at Nelson. I couldn't tell if Nelson was shouting back, but Greg gave it to him for a good 15-20 seconds. After Lewis ended, Nelson went over to fill up water and plopped back down on the bench dejected. Was this shown on TV and/or did anyone else see this in the stadium?

I think it is pretty extraordinary to have read the tweet and then ignored all the clear indications made in-app that there were ordinary uniques in the pool. I dont think it was *impossible* to have read the tweet and ignored the app, but it would almost take willful ignorance to have reached the point of pulling on the banner and still be under a genuine belief it was ssb+. I think this is not really a fight worth having... but who knows?!

1	Its probably related to your mmr	Lovemidlane	pcmasterrace	1	-1	-1	2016-11	1479160247	Lower FPS while connected main display with HDMI * Intel Core i5 2500K @ 3.30GHz * 8,00GB RAM * MSI Z68A-GD55 (G3) (MS-7681) * 2047MB NVIDIA GeForce GTX 750 Ti So this is a pretty annoying problem. Yesterday i plugged in my main display with HDMI instead of VGA mostly because when i use VGA there's this really weird static on the screen when playing games (i think it's the monitor that does that) So i booted up CS:GO first and i noticed that my FPS was really going up and down a lot which it have never done before. I play with a max FPS of 300 in CS:GO so i go way over the 60fps cap, usually it's around 120+ but now it was around 115 and went down to 90 a lot, it was noticeable. Now when playing Dota my FPS is going between 60-45 for some weird reason. There's no graphical change in any game or any resolution change either, it works flawless on VGA but as i said there's this weird static whenever i game and HDMI looks much clearer and more crisp. Anyone got any idea of what the reason may be? I have dual monitors aswell, but that shouldn't be a problem would it since it works fine on VGA?

Unfortunately due to our need for certain plugins to run our server, we will have to wait until Spigot for 1.11 is released. The release date for spigot is 11/19/16. However, since Alex and I both have awkward work schedules we will not be able to launch the server until **11/21/16**. However we will be having an event before we reset the server on Saturday at 10PM EST where we will be touring the current world and having some fun. Here is some extra information: 1.) Entity cramming will be turned **OFF** 2.) The world generation will be regular vanilla with slightly increased Iron spawns (Not as much as current world) 3.) World Spawn will be in a Jungle 4.) Iron farms will still be banned 5.) Graylist --- So to sum it up 11/20/16 will be the launch of Season 5 (Time: TBA), 11/19/16 will be the Final exploration of the 1.9/1.10 world. --- Can't wait to play some Minecraft with you guys! -g

Also ost 21.5 has one too. Just go to Amazon and type in those names with vitamin c. You also might want to go to Sephora and ask for some samples because they can be expensive, just ask about a vitamin c serum. Make sure to patch test and use sunscreen, the sunscreen from cerave at the drugstore is good. If you want me to link you I can, I'm just being lazy right now.

Eight years and change together, everything seemed totally fine, we talked about a future together plenty of times, engagement rings, jobs, housing, kids, etc. The job and housing parts were going forward and she had shown me rings and talked weddings plenty so it felt like it was time to finally do that. Bought a ring, tried planning some neat trips to take her on for an awesome proposal, they kept not happening, finally decided I was just going to do it around New Years, but right before that she bailed. Timing was just so perfect for her not to have figured it out. Never really got an explanation, just the general, ""I love you but I'm not in love with you."" One of those kinda generic statements that you hate to get, especially after so long, but at the same time I'm sure there was plenty of legitimacy to it. We met when we were young and we grew into different people. People change a lot between the mid teens and mid twenties. We tried to maintain a friendship for a while after that but it was super hard for me because I was still totally into her. I had to basically drop off the map entirely for a year or so because we shared the same social circle and I just got so incredibly uncomfortable around her. No hard feelings I guess at the end of the day, it sucked, but it wasn't like something awful happened between us. Eventually we just stopped talking. She drifted to a new social group, I got back in mine, life goes on. Definitely not where I expected to be at this point in my life though. Not anywhere near as exciting/interesting as some other stories."

0	Mormon God is like a shitty significant other who always takes from the relationship and never gives back.	Teancum94	exmormon	3	-1	-1	2016-12	1481660134	If gob's love is conditional yet he requires me to love him unconditionally something is wrong. It must have been lost in translation by his profits. Mormon doctrine states we are literal sons and daughters of god, he knows us personally down to the hair on our heads he is all knowing and all seeing. As our creator he wants to see us progress to exaltation and return back to him. Why would his love for us as his sons and daughters be conditional when we trip and fall on our path back to him? His love being conditional based on obedience is false doctrine perpetuated by TSCC. After all JC said if one sheep leaves the flock of 99 the Shepard will leave the flock to find the one. No conditions. Or the prodigal son.... God is not a respecter of persons, he loves and treats us all the same regardless of sins or sainthood. Mormons love to make shit up to justify their beliefs and keep you in the boat. So if you make a mistake in our trial and test in this life god leaves you; doesn't bless you or love you. Yeah that's the god I want to worship a total dick. I don't treat my children that way; I sure don't want god to treat me that way which is why I don't worship the Mormon ass hole god.

0	This is the only correct answer.	climberslacker	ems	4	-1	-1	2016-11	1479598909	Yes. Learn the actual pathophysiology behind it. pH of blood is determined by the amount of retained C02 held within the blood as bicarbonate. (H+ &amp; HCO3). Specifically those H+ ions determine the pH. Lots of H+ ions, = acidic. Too few = alkaline. So, if your patient hyperventilates, they blow off all of thier carbon dioxide. They lose H+ ions. They go into respiratory alkalosis. If your patient fails to do much of the breathing thing at all, poor tidal volume, dodgy exchange, they will fail to get rid of enough C02. The H+ ions will build up. They'll become acidotic.

Gen_Fredburger	StarWarsBattlefront	3	3	0	2016-09	1474742646	PSA: Your trip mine stays active if you switch loadouts Apologies if this is old news, but I figured it out last night and was too fired up not to share. Playing cargo on Rebel Depot in my defensive* loadout, which includes the trip mine: I had placed a trip mine at one of the side entrances to our base a while back, died, switched to my chase carriers/run the cargo loadout which does *not* include the trip mine. A minute later I get a notification that my previous trip mine took someone out. So trip mines stay active, even if you switch to a loadout that doesn't have the trip mine in it. I fully expected my mine to disappear when I spawned in with the other loadout. It effectively gives you 3 star cards for a limited time. *The ability to have a different trait with each loadout is worthy of its own strategy discussion thread, IMHO. TLDR: trip mines stay active until tripped or you place another mine

Every month, days before PPV's happen, I share my thoughts on the show and card and how I would book the show that has unexpected swerves, returns, debuts, and a memorable show that would leave fans happy. If you want, you can read some past editions of these by clicking on my name and searching. I have been doing these for every PPV since Night Of Champions 2015. I hope you enjoy, and this is how Survivor Series 2016 Should Be Booked.** **PRE SHOW** * Oh... oh god... it's 2 hours... We get the usual panel of Renee, Booker, Lita, and Jerry Lawler. Two Social Media Lounge segments are announced earlier in the day with Kalisto and Sami Zayn. There actually haven't been any Pre show matches announced as of yet, so we can use our IMAGINATION and make some up! We get to our first one. **1ST KICKOFF MATCH: Bo Dallas vs Curtis Axel** * At least this has a tiny bit of background behind it. Bo and Axel still have unfinished business after their mini feud a few weeks ago. Bo is out first followed by Axel. The match goes 8 minutes and Axel gets his win back after pinning Bo with a Perfect-Plex. **WINNER: Curtis Axel** * We get the SML with Kalisto and then the panel talks some more and give predictions and we get video packages and all that good stuff. We get to our 2nd kickoff match. **2ND KICKOFF MATCH: TJ Perkins, Neville, Cedric Alexander &amp; Rich Swann vs Ariya Daivari, Gran Metalik, Drew Gulak, &amp; Tony Nese** * 8 man tag. Neville should be part of the CW division. The heels are out first followed by the face Team. The match goes 14 minutes, and the faces win after Neville hits a Red Arrow onto Daivari's legs and then tags in TJ to locks in the kneebar on his injured knee. **WINNERS: TJ Perkins, Neville, Cedric Alexander and Rich Swann** * We get the Sami Zayn SML and then we get the panel's final predictions and thoughts, and we get to Survivor Series. **MAIN SHOW** * We get the opening video package and pyro as Michael Cole welcomes us to the 30th annual Survivor Series. Like Summerslam, the RAW team will call RAW matches, the SD team will call SD matches, and for dual brand matches, like the one that's kicking off, both teams will talk. **1ST MATCH: New Day, The Club, Cesaro &amp; Sheamus, Enzo &amp; Cass and the Shining Stars (TEAM RAW) vs Heath Slater &amp; Rhyno, Hype Bros, Breezango, The Usos and American Alpha (TEAM SD)** * New Day is out first and they have all sorts of canaidian stereotypes, as Big E tosses out Maple Syrup to the crowd, and Kofi has a canaidian flag, and Woods is wearing a Maple Leafs jersey playing a special red and white trombone. Their gear is red and white also. Slater/Rhyno out next, followed by Enzo and Cass, then Breezango, then The Shining Stars, then Hype Bros, The Club, Usos, Cesaro and Sheamus, and finally American Alpha. The match goes 28 minutes (SS matches are always really long, calm down). The champs on both respective brands start it off. The Hype Bros are eliminated first after the Club hits a magic killer. Next, The Usos eliminate Sheamus/Cesaro after arguing. New Day eliminate Breezango. Shining Stars eliminate Usos. It looks like RAW is killing SD, but SD make a comeback. AA eliminate Shining Stars and Enzo/Cass. Slater/Rhyno eliminate Club. New Day are the last RAW team left, and for SD it's down to AA and the champs. Woods has some shenanigans with the trombone on the outside and throws it at Slater and then Big E eliminates the SD Tag champs with a Midnight Hour. The lone survivors on either team are New Day and American Alpha. The crowd is electric and Jason Jordan and Big E are the legal men. They lock up and they fight for 2-3 more minutes. The ref is distracted by Xaivier as he thinks he's trying to help Big E, but suddenly two men in hoods come from under the ring. They lay out Kofi and Xaivier and then run to the back. It would be revealed the next night on Raw that the masked men would be the debuting Revival, and in the main event they would defeat New Day for the titles. Revival would say they don't care about Brand Supremecy, and they damn sure didn't do it to help their formal rivals American Alpha. They wanted to make a name and deception overcame New Day to give the TOP GUYS a title shot, that they knew with !00% certainty they would win. Alpha hit Grand Amplitude on Big E and AMERICAN ALPHA are now instantly over to the spot they deserve and they look impressive. Alpha would say on SD that they didn't like the way they won, but they knew they would for SD. American Alpha are the lone survivors, and would challenge for the Tag Titles against Slater/Rhyno at TLC in a Chairs match. I'll have the match card for TLC at the end of this post. **WINNERS: TEAM SD** *LONE SURVIVORS: AMERICAN ALPHA* * We get an ad for WWE Shop. **2ND MATCH: Brian Kendrick (c) vs Kalisto (Cruiserweight Championship; if Kalisto wins, the CW's move to SDLIVE)** * Kendrick is out first followed by Kalisto. The match goes 13 minutes. I hate to be having so many title changes in such a short amount of time, but it's obvious that Kalisto will and should win here because 205Live is right after SD. Plus, Kalisto was US Champ at the beginning of the year, so he has credibility, and he's really good. The match ends when Kendrick locks in the Captain's Hook, but Kalisto leans against Kendrick and makes his way to his feet, still holding on to Kendrick's head, and then runs off the ropes and hits a Salida Del Sol for the win and title. **WINNER and NEW CRUISERWEIGHT CHAMPION: Kalisto** * We get a backstage interview with American Alpha about being the lone survivors and winning for SD. **3RD MATCH: Charlotte Flair, Sasha Banks, Bayley, Nia Jax &amp; Alicia Fox (Team Raw) vs Becky Lynch, Alexa Bliss, Naomi, Carmella, &amp; Nikki Bella w/ Natlaya (TEAM SD)** * Bayley is out first followed by Becky Lynch, Nia Jax, Carmella, Alicia Fox, Alexa Bliss, Sasha, Naomi, Charlotte, and finally captain Nikki Bella with coach Natalya. The match goes 22 minutes. Sasha and Alexa start things off. Nia Jax eventually gets in and plows through everyone and eliminates Naomi and Carmella to get Raw a good start. Becky locks in the Disarmer on Alicia to tap her out and eliminate her. Bayley hits a Bayley to Belly through the SD announce desk to eliminate Alexa. I love Alexa the most out of anyone on this team, but Becky and Nikki should be the final two on SD. At least it's a big way to send her out. Sasha hits a Backstabber into a Bank Statement to tap out Nikki, and Nikki goes to the back and shes about to do the same to Becky but all of a sudden Charlotte runs in and throws Sasha out of the ring. She just wants to be a dick heel. She wants the pin for herself. The glory for herself. She throws out Banks and runs off the ropes and hits a spear to Becky to win the Women's match for Team Raw. It's 1-1. **WINNERS: TEAM RAW** *Lone Survivors: Charlotte Flair, Sasha Banks, Nia Jax &amp; Bayley* * We get an ad for TLC. **4TH MATCH: Kevin Owens, Chris Jericho, Seth Rollins, Braun Strowman &amp; Roman Reigns (TEAM RAW) vs AJ Styles, Dean Ambrose, Bray Wyatt, Randy Orton &amp; Shane McMahon w/ James Ellsworth (TEAM SD)** * I'M #TEAMBRAUN. Owens is out first followed by Bray Wyatt &amp; Randy Orton, then Chris Jericho, Shane McMahon, Roman Reigns, Dean Ambrose and James Ellsworth, Braun Strowman, AJ Styles, and finally Seth Rollins. The match goes 35 minutes, and has lots of first time interactions that everyone will jizz over and lots of big spots and moves. Rollins and Reigns argue over who will start the match and Ambrose walks up to them for a huge pop for another mini Shield Reunion. Ambrose gives them both a jumping Dirty Deeds. Ambrose throws Reigns out and Rollins and Ambrose start the match. Orton eliminates Roman after Roman hits Orton with a Superman Punch, and then runs off the ropes to hit a spear but Orton catches him Midair with an RKO. Shane hits Jericho with a Coast to Coast with a trashcan to eliminate Y2J. Bray and Strowman are the legal men at one point and they have a staredown. Suddenly, Luke Harper runs in from behind and Orton RKOs the ref and Harper and Bray beat down Strowman with steel chairs. Wyatt hits a Sister Abigail to eliminate Strowman. It's not looking good for RAW. Strowman gets offered to be helped out by trainer but he pushes them all down. As Strowman is walking to the ramp, Ellsworth runs up and extends his hand to a HUGE pop. The man that started it all for the Chinless Wonder. Strowman looks pissed and Ellsworth realizes what hes done. James tries to run but Strowman catches him and MURDERS him by giving him a Running Powerslam through the barricade. Owens starts to make a comeback as Rollins is laid out on the outside and he gets RKO'ed by Orton. Rollins runs in to try to help but he eats a Styles Clash from AJ. It's 1-5. Kevin Owens is the last member of Team Raw to a full Team SD. Owens has the ""Yeah I'm fucked"" look on his face. Styles hits a Pele Kick on Owens as he turns around. Owens is down now and Styles goes to the apron to set up the Forearm. Owens is up and Styles is about to jump but Bray Wyatt runs in and hits a Sister Abigail to pin Owens and win for Team SD. Wyatt celebrates as AJ is still on the apron and looks stunned. Styles goes in the ring and pushes Wyatt. Wyatt and Styles have words and Styles says that that was his pin. Styles slaps Bray and Bray laughs. Wyatt hits a Sister Abigail on Styles and then holds up the WWE World Title to a huge pop. Styles is laid out and Wyatt drops the title over Styles then walks out. Another Wrestlemania storyline has just begun. **WINNER: TEAM SD** *LONE SURVIVORS: Clean Sweep* * We get an ad for the network and Wrestlemania. **5TH MATCH: The Miz (c) vs Sami Zayn (Intercontinental Championship)** * Sami is out first followed by Miz. I really don't get why they had Ziggler lose the title last week. Sami is just gonna win it here. Maybe they wanted to keep Ziggler looking strong for something. The match goes 16 minutes and Zayn wins the title after he hits a Helluva kick. But then he wants to really send a statement. He puts Miz back in the corner for a second Helluva kick. 1. 2. 3. Sami Zayn is finally champ. Zayn is interviewed after the match by Byron Saxton and there is confetti everywhere. Zayn talks about what he went through to get to this point. He says he think he would be treated better on SD, and disses Mick and Stephanie, and says the IC Title is STAYING on SD, because he's GOING to SD! **WINNER and NEW IC CHAMP: Sami godamn Zayn** **6TH MATCH: Brock Lesnar w/ Paul Heyman vs Goldberg** * This match will be very interesting. The crowd reaction and how Goldberg does, as he's 49, hasn't wrestled in 12 years, and tweaked his shoulder on RAW. We get a video package before the match and Lesnar is out first followed by Goldberg. All main roster and NXT talent are there and we see DIY doing their Glorious Bomb during the entrance with their newly won NXT Tag Titles as they promised. The match goes 11 minutes, because there's no way Goldberg can do a really long match. At first, as a rib to the fans, they lock up once for a few seconds, then break it then lock up again, as a flashback to what their WM20 match was. They try to lock up one more time but Lesnar gets Goldberg up on his shoulders and hits an F-5, and Goldberg just barely kicks out. Hopefully it's much better than expected and exceed's everyone's expectations. In one spot, Goldberg spears Lesnar into the ring post. The big spot in the match is when Goldberg nails Lesnar with a Jackhammer through the RAW table. Lesnar works over Goldberg's arm the whole match and at one point he powerbombs Goldberg onto the apron and Goldberg's arm lands on the edge. The match ends when Lesnar locks in the Kimura Lock on Goldberg and in kayfabe breaks his arm, and Goldberg taps out. Lesnar hasn't won with the Kimura Lock in a while, and it would tell a good story here. After the match Goldberg is put in a Splint and stretchered out. Lesnar is celebrating and poses on the middle rope as pyro goes off. Lesnar has won the mega match. The camera is focused on Lesnar as he gets down and we hear the crowd erupt. All of a sudden, Samoa Joe runs and nails Lesnar with his newly won NXT Title. Just because Joe won back the title doesn't mean he can't be on the main roster, as many superstars have done the same, and he's no doubt losing it back to Nakamura at the show in Osaka, Japan in December. Heyman screams at Joe but then Heyman tries to apologize and says his ""I;m just an advocate"" line and Joe grabs him by the collar and hurls him over the ropes. Joe nails Lesnar with a Muscle Buster and then locks in the Coquina Clutch and won't break it even after all the trainers and refs in the locker room spill out to try to stop him. Joe finally breaks it. We have another Wrestlemania storyline begun. **WINNER: Brock Lesnar** *TLC CARD (SDLIVE)* * WWE World Title: AJ Styles (c) vs Dean Ambrose (TLC) * IC Title: Sami Zayn (c) vs The Miz vs Bray Wyatt vs Dolph Ziggler (Tables) * SD Tag Titles: Slater/Rhyno (c) vs American Alpha (Chairs) * SD Women's Title: Becky Lynch (c) vs Alexa Bliss (Ladder) * Kane vs Luke Harper * Carmella and Natalya vs Nikki Bella and Naomi * Pre Show: Baron Corbin vs Kalisto (No.1 Contendership to IC Title) I'll have my card for the Royal Rumble for both brands on my How WWE Should Book TLC 2016 post. I hope you all enjoyed! This was a longer one. Tell me what you liked or didn't like and what on here you'd like to see happen on the show! Enjoy Survivor Series everybody!"

The movie followed a group of Confederate soldiers (the Polks had a Confederate flag) who took refuge in an abandoned plantation. They soon discovered the home was haunted by spirits. In the end, everyone dies. Some interesting points include a character who was a nurse and a spirit who shows another character what happened to create the events that surround the house.

But when you realize that you can't even kill a tier 3 map boss, I just turned off the game and don't think I'm going back this league. 20k ice crash dps 27k ancestral totem dps 6k life Max res 5k armor plus flask used Can't do damage to bosses I have to quit this bitch lol"

1	I got my used S5 by ordering a new one from Amazon.	RandomKraut	galaxys5	1	-1	-1	2016-11	1479823332	Buying a used S5 - tips and advice Hi everyone, I searched through the thread but couldn't find a post that could help me out. Basically I've found a couple of used S5 on a local site, sellers seem legit, but I wanted to see if you could give me any pointers or a checklist for what to look out for when I'm testing it out with the seller. I'm mostly worried about it being a clone and/or the hardware being modded with lesser parts. Is there anything else I should look out for? How testable *is* the phone at the point of sale? I've seen there being diagnostic software, but I can't really bring my laptop along. Will I need to bring a sim or have to log in with a google account? I know there's codes (i.e. *0# and the likes), but I'm not sure what info they cover. Open for any advice!

0	In Windows?	LarkoGaming	Guitar	2	-1	-1	2016-11	1479852825	You can also reduce latency by not setting the highest quality sample rate and bit depth. If you can live with 44.1khz sample rate and 16-bit depth, then that'll help lower your latency. You can probably use 48khz and 16-bit depth just as easily. If you can use 48khz and 24-bit, that's about as good as you need to go for guitar, there's really no need to use any sample rate higher than 48khz, and 44.1khz should be fine as well (at least for practicing). 24-bit depth is ideal to avoid aliasing in any case, but the demands on your sample buffer are increased exponentially from 16-bit.

1	But if we audit the votes, doesn't that mean they can't *release* the vote count?	lagerbaer	politics	10	-1	-1	2016-11	1479885318	Politics aside. What's wrong with doing an audit? Trump used to say the election was rigged, and he wouldn't accept the results unless he won. This doesn't seem like we're saying we don't accept the results. But we just want to make sure they were correctly counted, and that there is no reason for us NOT to accept the results. Subtle difference, but a tangible one. An audit is not the same as not accepting the results. If you're audited for your taxes, the auditors aren't saying you've done your taxes wrong, they just want to make sure you did them right.

0	To be THE final map is very dissapointment	WoWCoreT	CODZombies	1	1	0	2016-09	1473611423	This map is very repetitive I have 6 days of playtime in BO3 and even more in BO2. Almost every map to come out in these games has mad me hooked for weeks (even tranzit and zetsoubou), but I get bored of this map so fast. I don't know if its because they added nothing to this map besides a new spawn room, but I got bored within 10 minutes of my first playthrough. I have been trying to give the map a chance and have played it for about 4-5 hours in total, but the whole time it has felt like a drag. My friends are all burnt out on it in less than a week. This map is so easy to get to high rounds on that theres never any interesting moments. I know the easter egg hasnt been solved yet, but thats something that most people will only do once. This map has been a huge disappointment for me.

0	Wow, the fact that you truly believe this is true even without actual data shows just how ignorant and racist you really are.	fuck_you_people____	korea	3	3	0	2016-09	1474128760	This article is as good as it gets, unfortunately. The IRS doesn't keep records of tax avoidance by ethnic origin, so the best data that is available is based on income by ethnicity or income by region, and as you can see in this article it always shows East Asians, particularly first generation immigrants, or areas with large numbers of them, declaring very low incomes. For example, the wealthy suburb of Richmond BC in Canada has unusually low income rates, with many reporting 0 income yet living in multi-million dollar homes. I've said it before, that East Asians, particularly Chinese and Koreans show a pattern of using deception. It's deeply cultural. Failure to acknowledge it doesn't make it go away. Asians are way overrepresented in cases of academic dishonesty in US universities for example. I'm not going to bother citing sources since you wouldn't react this way if you didn't already know it was common knowledge among all people in the world.

That's like claiming that because I ate a carrot along with my medium-rare 16 oz steak for lunch that I am becoming a vegan. Incidentally processors like M0 are bottom-end processors. They are a alternative to dedicated microcontrollers and 8-bit processors, not something you would ever run a OS on.

And Jean Grey is my favorite. I was familiar with the X-Men (shows, games, movies), but I didn't actually read any comics until the Marvel NOW All-New, Uncanny, and adjective-less X-Books. I definitely let the weight of continuity stop me from jumping into comics earlier. I found it extremely appealing to read about characters I was familiar with, but without having to worry about everything that came before. Jean was always my favorite because of her power set and the Phoenix, but I especially loved the visuals of her powers when Bendis did that combined Telepathy + Telekinesis stuff in The Trial of Jean Grey arc. Needless to say...I am HYPED UP for X-Men: Blue. O5 back together...Jean Grey as the team leader...AND Magneto as the mentor? FUCK YEAH

Zachmdful	AskReddit	1	-1	-1	2016-12	1480669345	This takes me way back to my pre-teens, but a friend mine pointed out to me that a skateboard deck would drastically drop in price if a scratch were to appear on it... I'm guessing that the concept would probably apply to many different types of products. Unfortunately at some point I developed a moral conscience and wouldn't pull that now... I would still pull the second trick though... When rich kids bought new skateboards, they'd just leave the old board at the shop. The shop couldn't sell it, so it went in the dumpster. A lot of useful shit goes in dumpsters. Huh. It's just occurring to me now that I haven't gone dumpster diving in 15 years... I should probably try that again.

So I came inside her for the next couple of times (I trusted her--had no reason not to). At some point I asked what kind of birth control she was on, and she said something about eating certain vitamins and that she's learned to control her body and use dietary supplements to consciously control her body and not get pregnant.

The original BLM rhetoric was actually a racist ideology until some people, who aren't leaders within the movement but claim to have roots in the organization, claim that BLM means Black Lives Matter (too). So someone came up with Blue Lives Matter to combat the original monkier because cops were getting shat on by the (unfair and unjustified) rhetoric that cops are the bad guys. It isn't racism fueled when equal sides of the playing field support Law Enforcement. You think only whites support law enforcement? How does Blue Lives Matter reinforce or substantiate white privilege?

0	This is a pretty good theory on the first and second trailer, my thoughts were that whoever Mad's character is - is the one harvesting all the life from fertile creatures to resurrect dead soldiers regardless of how long they've been dead (he's made an army out of them apparently) - and Mads himself appears to be a Soldier as well, Kojima seems to have a thing for soldier comradery (Diamond Dogs / Big Boss, all that jazz) so perhaps this guy has some kind of vendetta against the *powers at be* for what I couldn't guess other than perhaps he was their guinea pig for some crazy experiment and they turned him into some kind of Demigod and now he's getting his revenge on all the governments and their false justifications for sending millions of soldiers to their deaths for greedy purposes like oil or whatever - but I kinda like your Limbo theory better and it really seems to fit the bill with the things you mentioned in your post.	Aluraine	DeathStranding	7	-1	-1	2016-12	1480674899	"The game takes place in limbo If not the christian limbo, then the one from whatever religion this ""Decima"" is from. The idea of a purgatory or a similar 'waiting room for the souls of the dead' is a common theme in many world religions. The egyptians had one, the greeks had one, the christians have one, obv.- And there's a throughline through many of them. Stillborn babies go there. If you were never truly born, whether you're a dead unbaptized christian baby or a mummified egyptian stillborn fetus, a lot of religions say you go to a place of undeath, between the realms. A place for people with no souls, or no true sins. Often you can atone and earn your way into the good afterlife, one way or another - but you'll be at it, generally, for hundreds of years, for whatever reason. I believe that our actor friends- Mads, Reedus, and Del Toro - Are all people from our world who found their way into purgatory / limbo, one way or another. The technology - Reedus' and Toros' handcuffs, the baby - chamber, this all serves to allow living creatures to transcend the planes of existence and enter the afterlife. I think each person did this differently. Perhaps Reedus and Mads are clones - Bred for battle and made by man, they have no true souls and are thus welcome in Limbo. Perhaps Toros, with his head scars, is some sort of brain trauma / coma victim, thus also perfect for the job. All three enter Limbo via the power of undeath - An unborn fetus, suspended chemically between life and death, the state of each can be altered at will. Somehow the handcuff does the dirty. Toro still clings to life in the realm of the living. Unlike the two clone soldiers, he is not ready for death, and must journey through the land of the dead with the fetus in tow in order to awaken in his real body. Reedus awakens in the first trailer to see that Toro is no longer cuffed to him, and has taken his child - and perhaps his soul? I believe the baby is linked to Reedus, perhaps it is a clone as well, thus making it easier to bridge the gap allowing transmit into the next realm. Thus, reedus must follow after Toro, trying to get his baby self-soul back. Mads is another soldier within the same program who went into the upside-down and got all colonel kurtz with some WWII era soldiers. speaking of the soldiers- And the whales - And everything else, they are all, of course, the many souls who died in battle and did not atone for their sins. Like in Dantes' hell, they shamble about, slowly losing themselves and their minds until one day they might finally transcend. Mads is connecting to them with his soul-umbilical the same way Reedus and toro used theirs to interface with the soul-baby-transporter. the soul umbilical can be used to control things in the environment because all other things within the environment are soulless husks, wandering about, waiting for infinity. the five angels at the end of the trailer are literally that - five angels, a council sworn to uphold the law of life in a realm of undeath. Seeing Reedus is a puzzling thing. he should not be here. But they watch, not interfering, until they can be the bosses. At least, that's my tinfoil theory. What did you guys think?"

Activision wants to end BO3's life cycle and move players to their new COD installment Infinite Warfare, and the game isn't selling well as it is. They're giving out free copies at this point, and they won't allow Treyarch release another DLC that will essentially move the player population back to BO3. They're done milking out that game for the year and want to move on. DLC maps cost a lot of time and money and they won't invest a huge chunk just to reverse they're player-base. Plus, the seasonpass explicitly mentions that you will get 4 map packs. And we all know Activision won't be generous enough give out a free map pack out of altruism.

To get a build ready for beta / alpha / tech test you need to remove elements and test for stability. This takes a lot of time as well as man power. So either include the tech test for PC and have to potentially postpone the release of the game (this makes no sense since they can test the servers with consoles just as well) or exclude the PC build and release the game on time Decisions were made, they are shitty to us PC players, but they were made none the less They are not neglecting the PC community, I can assure you of that!
0	Those middle eastern societes have had civilisations thousand of years before the West though, so what really is civilisation and who is really civilised?	Penguin327	TheRedPill	1	-1	-1	2016-12	1481803648	"Civilization = feminization. I wanted to share something I am currently noticing. It is a perspective/theory. You can think it is stupid or true as with any perspective. Sorry for the formatting. I look outside. Hot girls are walking around and don't show any interest to me. Below average woman think she is decent. We let them think this way. We let them take the upper hand. ""Hi boss, I am happy with working double shift you should still pay me the same tough."" Fucking civilization. Civilization means feminization. That middle east societies. They don't seem civilized. They keep their women under control. They get to fuck cleaner women. They get to not divorce raped as much as us. When we were cavemen, we could just take what we wanted. Now do that. And you go to jail and they ass rape you. This is what civilization means. Women and men who are like women associated civilization with feminization. Now we all think it is great but it is basically a trojan virus. Like a pirated game that has a small piece of code that fucks your computer. It is the exact same thing, in fact. Clean clothes, ironed clothes, nice cars (what the fuck is a nice car anyway), talking elagantly, socializing like a women. We are being forced to do these but do we really need them? Fuck no. Why the fuck would we iron our clothes? Among men, how do we make use of clean clothes? It is a necessaty for social status assesment and piss contest. Guess why? So women can look at you and understand how much value she can get from you. Women make men compete with each other by such means. Men think with their egos. Women picks their likings meanwhile. I am fucking afraid of stepping into a pool of water because it is gonna make my jean dirty. I am lazy to clean it. But I should be able to do whatever the fuck I want when walking. Dude it is walking. I can jump. I should be able to jump. I should be able to scream. But if you scream now they ask you wtf dude, they call the police, they look at you like you are a weirdo. You are being conditioned to be restricted every single minute of your day because you are a part of society and civilization. It is created to keep you under control. Civilization exists to make you beta so civilization can protect itself and whoever gets the biggest pie of civilization, aka people who have power, money etc. So what do we do? Do we need to blow up buildings like tyler durden does in fight club? Do we need to join some weird ass religion? I don't know. I think we just should do whatever the fuck we want to do. Why there is no cult that has TRP perspectives? Maybe there is. There is scientology. There are weird ass religions. Why don't some people bought an island, bring some girls etc. etc. Because that is dumb. I see this reality of society right now. I can just join top 1% instead of doing other things to get the biggest reward of this shitty situation. Kill or be killed right? So whoever think like me, do probably the same. Sure they lose some things and never get certain things they really want to get, but I guess everything is a tradeoff. Why bother to change society? Most won't understand you. Most will shit at you. You won't get any tangible benefit from it. Life is too short to think too much anyway. Life is interesting. It seems whether you make $30k, $300k, $30mm, ass fucked in a jail cell, cucked by your wife, or have a harem of 5 girls, all you can choose is 1. to look at life with a positive perspective and feel happy-ish 2. to look at what's wrong in life and feel not happy Then you die."

0	It's worth it to see him pout when he is not winning.	curly_spork	nfl	1	1	0	2016-09	1475021575	Well his one touchdown against the Vikings for example. Did his slow dance, handed a ball off, then did some modeling/photog session on the sideline forever. I don't really mind him doing stuff on the sideline but all the networks make non panther fans suffer through every celebratory act he does. Fans should only be shown the end zone dance and then move along. Kinda glad he did that dance though because the Vikes got fired up afterwards
0	I can't remember but would a snow golem be the easiest solution since they attack creepers?	k4b6	feedthebeast	1	-1	-1	2016-12	1481822322	How do I make a charged creeper explode? When a mob dies to a charged creeper blast it has a 100% chance to drop its head. So I built a wither skull farm that is using a charged creeper to kill wither skeletons. I've managed to get the creepers charged, and stick them in a 1x2 hole made of reinforced obsidian. I can protect any other key blocks from exploding. I can manage to pack a hundred or so wither skeletons in there with the charged creeper every minute. Fully automated to this point, except I can't make the creeper explode. When a player uses flint and steel on it, the creeper automatically explodes. I figured I could use the igniter from Roots to accomplish the same thing, but all it does is set the creeper on fire. Same with the igniter from Random Things. I even tried a vanilla dispenser with flint and steel, no luck. It's fun to watch them burn, but I want explosions. It seems that the creeper needs to be ignited by a player. The mechanical player from Extra Utilities won't work. Blowing them up with TNT was fun but didn't work. This is an awesome build and I would hate to see it go to waste. Is there any mod out there that has an item that makes all nearby creepers explode? I'm playing a custom pack on 1.10. I can add any mods.
