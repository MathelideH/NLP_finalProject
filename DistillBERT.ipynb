For this reason, try to train your models on as much data as possible, but do not worry if you are not able to train it on all of the data. You can also try to run the models on your personal computers without using GPUs! Just make sure to upload the correct .ipynb with outputs to Gradescope. "

Based on these metrics, this model is performing much better than our Bayesian classifiers, even though our DistilBERT model were only validated on a small dev_test and tested on a small test_set (due to RAM issues). The DistilBERT model also improves significantly more than the Naive Bayes: hyperparameter tuning only helps NB to improve accuracy by ~10%, while DistilBERT increases accuracy by ～15% after being trained.\n",

The current model is able to learn multiple dependencies through multiple layers with attention masks specifying which aspects of the embeddings are important to keep in mind, thus being able to generalize/predict for longer sequences. Thus, DistiBERT can improve much more at predicting by training and fine-tuning, while NB does not increase its classifying accuracy by as much via hyper-parameter tuning.\n",
        "- Benefit of being bidirectional and implementing [MASK] as a Transformer: Furthermore, one limitations of our bayesian classfiers was that they are limited by a fixed context-window of n-grams (unigrams and bigrams here) when making predictions, while the DistiBERT model are bidirectional, thus can perform the classification based on a much broader scope of data and attend to important contexts. Thus, even when evaluated on a small set, it has much higher accuracy than an n-gram model.\n",
        "- Benefits of positional embeddings: NB assumes a bag-of-word assumption, and does not take into account the words' positions, hence ignoring the temporal nature of language. DistiBERT, through bidirectional representation learning and positional encoding + self-attention, captures the relevance of a tokens in a current context."

The number of epochs are the number of iterations the current model will perform as it learns over the dataset, while the batch size refers to the number of sentences the model will take to learn during each iteration. In addition, we can also change attributes to customize the training, such as: evaluation_strategy, learning_rate, weight_decay,etc.\n",

For example, 2-5 for the num_epoch and 3-50 taking consideration of both the time of training and the performance of the model. Using these two random number, we will evaluate on the validation (dev) set and identify a pattern between these two hyperparameters and accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score that can help guide us to the optimal set of batchsize and num_epochs. We can also implement grid search to find the optimal combinations of hyperparameters, which yields the maximum accuracy/F-1 scores.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another way to find the optimal hyperparameters is to to use a loss function for the result of the learning. We can choose a series of epoch numbers to be tested upon the dev data set and compare the total loss for each num_epoch. We can either plot out the loss in a function and search for a local(ideally global) minimum, or manually set an acceptable shreshold for the loss value. In this way, we can find the optimal possible number of epochs to use for the model, likewise for the batch_size when matched with a specific epoch number."
